👋 Thanks for the contribution! LibreChat merges all changes into \`$TARGET_BASE\` first — \`$RELEASE_BASE\` only moves at release time — so this pull request's base branch was switched from \`$RELEASE_BASE\` to \`$TARGET_BASE\` automatically.

Nothing is needed from you; your commits, reviews and discussion are unchanged. If the diff now shows files you did not touch, rebase onto \`$TARGET_BASE\`:

\`\`\`bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/$REPO.git
git fetch upstream $TARGET_BASE
git rebase upstream/$TARGET_BASE
git push --force-with-lease
\`\`\`

Maintainers: apply the \`$KEEP_LABEL\` label and restore the base branch if this one genuinely belongs on \`$RELEASE_BASE\`.
