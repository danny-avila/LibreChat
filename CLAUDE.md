# LibreChat

## Project Overview

LibreChat is a monorepo with the following key workspaces:

| Workspace | Language | Side | Dependency | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `/api` | JS (legacy) | Backend | `packages/api`, `packages/data-schemas`, `packages/data-provider`, `@librechat/agents` | Express server — minimize changes here |
| `/packages/api` | **TypeScript** | Backend | `packages/data-schemas`, `packages/data-provider` | New backend code lives here (TS only, consumed by `/api`) |
| `/packages/data-schemas` | TypeScript | Backend | `packages/data-provider` | Database models/schemas, shareable across backend projects |
| `/packages/data-provider` | TypeScript | Shared | — | Shared API types, endpoints, data-service — used by both frontend and backend |
| `/client` | TypeScript/React | Frontend | `packages/data-provider`, `packages/client` | Frontend SPA |
| `/packages/client` | TypeScript | Frontend | `packages/data-provider` | Shared frontend utilities |

The source code for `@librechat/agents` (major backend dependency, same team) lives at
<https://github.com/danny-avila/agents>.

---

## Workspace Boundaries

- **All new backend code must be TypeScript** in `/packages/api`.
- Keep `/api` changes to the absolute minimum (thin JS wrappers calling into `/packages/api`).
- Database-specific shared logic goes in `/packages/data-schemas`.
- Frontend/backend shared API logic (endpoints, types, data-service) goes in `/packages/data-provider`.
- Build data-provider from project root: `npm run build:data-provider`.

## Branching and Pull Requests

- **Branch off `dev`, and target `dev` with every pull request.** All work lands on `dev` first.
- **`main` is the released branch.** It is kept as a fast-forward of `dev` and synced as-is, so it
  is always an ancestor of `dev` — equal to it right after a sync, behind it otherwise. It never
  carries a commit that `dev` does not have.
- **Never open a backport pull request to `main`.** Anything merged to `dev` reaches `main` at the
  next sync; a second pull request for the same change is redundant.
- **The repository's default branch is `main`**, so `gh pr create` and the GitHub UI target it
  unless told otherwise — always pass `--base dev` explicitly.
- Pull requests opened against `main` are retargeted to `dev` automatically by
  `.github/workflows/pr-retarget-dev.yml`. The `target: main` label exempts one, as do release-bound
  upstream branches (`dev`, `release/*`, `hotfix/*`). Backport branches are deliberately not exempt —
  a backport merged straight to `main` is what breaks the fast-forward invariant.
- **`Fixes #N` does not close the issue.** GitHub honors closing keywords only when a pull request
  merges into the default branch (`main`). Merging to `dev` does not close anything, and the later
  fast-forward of `main` is not a merge event either — close linked issues by hand.
- **Git worktrees share one stash stack.** `refs/stash` lives in the common `.git` directory, so a
  bare `git stash pop` in one worktree can take work stashed in another. Prefer a throwaway WIP
  commit; if you must stash, `git stash push -m <tag>` and `apply` that specific entry.
- **Write the description for a reader who has not followed the branch.** Say what breaks, what
  triggers it, and how it behaves after the change, then show the mechanism with whichever one or
  two views make it reviewable — a focused diff, a call tree, a shallow file tree, or a Mermaid
  sequence — keeping only the calls, files and state the change actually carries. Describe the code
  as it stands: do not narrate what earlier commits tried or what a review round changed. Naming the
  merged pull request that caused the bug is different — that is history the reader needs.
  `.github/pull_request_template.md` carries the formats and examples.

## Review and Completion

### AI review cycles

The reviewer, its trigger phrase and its cadence all change; this subsection is the fluid one, so
rewrite it when they do. What survives a change of tool: a review counts only for the exact commit
it ran on, its findings are judged against the code rather than accepted or dismissed wholesale, and
findings that keep arriving mean the subsystem needs a sweep, not another patch.

- **Inline review threads are the source of truth.** A summary comment, a check name or a
  notification list omits findings — read the threads on the pull request itself.
- Audit every finding against the current code. Fix the valid ones; reject the obsolete or wrong
  ones in a reply that says why.
- After each round of fixes, run the focused tests and `npx tsc --noEmit` for every workspace you
  changed, push, read the pull request's remote head (`gh pr view <n> --json headRefOid`), and
  request the next review naming that exact SHA. **A clean review of an earlier head says nothing
  about what you just pushed.** Do not wait for CI before asking — review and CI run on their own
  clocks.
- Reply on each thread you resolved with the commit that resolved it and the coverage that proves
  it.
- **After two actionable rounds** — or sooner, when each fix uncovers an adjacent defect — stop
  answering threads one at a time and read the subsystem by invariant: identity, ownership,
  authorization, persistence, retry, replay, abort, cleanup, expiry, rollout. Follow producers,
  consumers, adapters, alternate write paths, and the final consumer of every limit; check
  mixed-version behavior in both directions; read the whole base-to-head diff with the callers and
  tests around it; then add transition or failure-injection coverage at the deepest boundary that
  owns the behavior.
- The cycle ends when the exact pushed head draws no major findings, or only repeats ones already
  resolved. A clean review is one completion signal, not the definition of done.

### Definition of done

- **Ship the observable experience, not the reported path.** Where they apply, cover loading, empty,
  success, failure, cancellation, retry and restored-session behavior.
- **A backend capability with no frontend entry point is unfinished**, and so is a control with no
  validation, persistence, error handling or authorization behind it.
- Localize every visible string through `useLocalize()`, keep semantic HTML, keyboard behavior and
  ARIA intact, and compose shared primitives and semantic theme roles before adding local styling
  (see "Frontend Rules"). Custom styling that proves unavoidable still supports light/dark and
  reduced motion.
- Preserve existing defaults, configuration compatibility, stored data, and mixed-version behavior.
- Make the fix the smallest one consistent with the patterns already in the file, and test the
  behavior that was missed rather than the line a reviewer pointed at.
- **Report what you actually ran**: the pushed head, the local checks from "Testing" and
  "Typechecking", CI state, the review result at that head, and any finding you rejected with the
  reasoning. Name the checks you could not run instead of implying coverage.

## Code Style

### Naming and File Organization

- **Single-word file names** whenever possible (e.g., `permissions.ts`, `capabilities.ts`, `service.ts`).
- When multiple words are needed, prefer grouping related modules under a **single-word directory** rather than using multi-word file names (e.g., `admin/capabilities.ts` not `adminCapabilities.ts`).
- The directory already provides context — `app/service.ts` not `app/appConfigService.ts`.

### Structure and Clarity

- **Never-nesting**: early returns, flat code, minimal indentation. Break complex operations into well-named helpers.
- **Functional first**: pure functions, immutable data, `map`/`filter`/`reduce` over imperative loops. Only reach for OOP when it clearly improves domain modeling or state encapsulation.
- **No dynamic imports** unless absolutely necessary.

### DRY

- Extract repeated logic into utility functions.
- Reusable hooks / higher-order components for UI patterns.
- Parameterized helpers instead of near-duplicate functions.
- Constants for repeated values; configuration objects over duplicated init code.
- Shared validators, centralized error handling, single source of truth for business rules.
- Shared typing system with interfaces/types extending common base definitions.
- Abstraction layers for external API interactions.

### Iteration and Performance

- **Minimize looping** — especially over shared data structures like message arrays, which are iterated frequently throughout the codebase. Every additional pass adds up at scale.
- Consolidate sequential O(n) operations into a single pass whenever possible; never loop over the same collection twice if the work can be combined.
- Choose data structures that reduce the need to iterate (e.g., `Map`/`Set` for lookups instead of `Array.find`/`Array.includes`).
- Avoid unnecessary object creation; consider space-time tradeoffs.
- Prevent memory leaks: careful with closures, dispose resources/event listeners, no circular references.

### Backend Database Performance

- On request startup and first page load paths, watch for serial database reads.
  Multiple round trips to MongoDB can add significant latency when the database
  is far from the app server.
- Prefer passing already-loaded request/user/config data through helper
  functions instead of re-reading the same user, role, tenant, or principal data.
- When two reads are independent, start them in parallel and gate the response
  on the authorization or validation result before returning data.
- Keep authorization, permission, and tenant checks semantically identical when
  parallelizing reads. Speculative reads must remain scoped to the authenticated
  user or tenant and must not write to the response before validation succeeds.

### Type Safety

- **Never use `any`**. Explicit types for all parameters, return values, and variables.
- **Limit `unknown`** — avoid `unknown`, `Record<string, unknown>`, and `as unknown as T` assertions. A `Record<string, unknown>` almost always signals a missing explicit type definition.
- **Don't duplicate types** — before defining a new type, check whether it already exists in the project (especially `packages/data-provider`). Reuse and extend existing types rather than creating redundant definitions.
- Use union types, generics, and interfaces appropriately.
- All TypeScript and ESLint warnings/errors must be addressed — do not leave unresolved diagnostics.

### Comments and Documentation

- Write self-documenting code; no inline comments narrating what code does.
- JSDoc only for complex/non-obvious logic or intellisense on public APIs.
- Single-line JSDoc for brief docs, multi-line for complex cases.
- Avoid standalone `//` comments unless absolutely necessary.

### Import Order

Imports are organized into three sections:

1. **Package imports** — sorted shortest to longest line length (`react` always first).
2. **`import type` imports** — sorted longest to shortest (package types first, then local types; length resets between sub-groups).
3. **Local/project imports** — sorted longest to shortest.

Multi-line imports count total character length across all lines. Consolidate value imports from the same module. Always use standalone `import type { ... }` — never inline `type` inside value imports.

### JS/TS Loop Preferences

- **Limit looping as much as possible.** Prefer single-pass transformations and avoid re-iterating the same data.
- `for (let i = 0; ...)` for performance-critical or index-dependent operations.
- `for...of` for simple array iteration.
- `for...in` only for object property enumeration.

## Frontend Rules (`client/src/**/*`)

### Localization

- All user-facing text must use `useLocalize()`.
- Only update English keys in `client/src/locales/en/translation.json` (other languages are automated externally).
- Semantic key prefixes: `com_ui_`, `com_assistants_`, etc.

### Components

- TypeScript for all React components with proper type imports.
- Semantic HTML with ARIA labels (`role`, `aria-label`) for accessibility.
- Group related components in feature directories (e.g., `SidePanel/Memories/`).
- Use index files for clean exports.

### Theming and styling

- **Compose before styling.** Search `@librechat/client` for an existing primitive, semantic
  variant, or composition before adding feature-local classes or CSS.
- **Use semantic roles.** Colors and shared appearance values must come from the semantic
  Tailwind/theme roles. Do not add raw palette utilities, hard-coded hex/RGB/HSL colors, or
  light/dark-specific values in feature components.
- **Deepen the system when the need is reusable.** Add a focused variant to a shared primitive or
  extend the canonical, versioned theme-token registry when multiple screens should share the
  same design decision. Do not create shallow local wrappers that merely relocate class strings.
- **Themes are data, not arbitrary CSS.** Theme definitions may select semantic colors and shared
  appearance roles. They must not contain selectors, arbitrary CSS, application behavior, or
  alternate feature layouts. Preserve existing environment and stored-theme compatibility when
  changing the theme engine.
- **Keep layout and behavior local.** Feature structure, responsive layout, state-driven
  transitions, and specialized visualization may remain feature-owned. Expose a theme role only
  when it represents a stable, reusable appearance decision; do not turn every measurement into a
  global token.
- **Treat custom CSS as an exception.** Use it only when shared primitives and semantic utilities
  cannot express the requirement. Keep it narrowly scoped, consume theme variables where
  applicable, support light/dark and reduced motion, and add a brief code or PR explanation of why
  the exception is necessary.
- **Preserve defaults and prove variability.** New theme-aware variants must reproduce the current
  default appearance unless a redesign is explicitly requested. Test semantic-token use and, when
  extending theme capabilities, include a deliberately different reference theme to prove that
  components adapt without feature-specific overrides.

### Data Management

- Feature hooks: `client/src/data-provider/[Feature]/queries.ts` → `[Feature]/index.ts` → `client/src/data-provider/index.ts`.
- React Query (`@tanstack/react-query`) for all API interactions; proper query invalidation on mutations.
- QueryKeys and MutationKeys in `packages/data-provider/src/keys.ts`.

### Client State Ownership

The client is migrating from Recoil to Jotai. Convert the areas you touch rather than
migrating wholesale, and split the work by who owns the state:

- **Feature-owned state** — atoms a single feature both writes and reads. Convert these to
  Jotai as you touch them, and keep them inside the feature.
- **App-global state** — preferences and shell state a feature merely consumes
  (`maximizeChatSpace`, `showScrollButton`, `enterToSend`, artifact visibility). A feature
  that could plausibly be extracted must not reach into `~/store` for these; accept them
  through props or a small context the host supplies.

Passing app-global state in — rather than reaching for it — is what lets a feature move to
its own workspace later without a rewrite, and it keeps the Jotai conversion scoped to the
state a feature actually owns instead of dragging the global migration forward early.

### Data-Provider Integration

- Endpoints: `packages/data-provider/src/api-endpoints.ts`
- Data service: `packages/data-provider/src/data-service.ts`
- Types: `packages/data-provider/src/types/queries.ts`
- Use `encodeURIComponent` for dynamic URL parameters.

### Performance

- Prioritize memory and speed efficiency at scale.
- Cursor pagination for large datasets.
- Proper dependency arrays to avoid unnecessary re-renders.
- Leverage React Query caching and background refetching.

## Backend Rules (`api/**`, `packages/api/**`)

### Auth cache invalidation

When adding or changing code that mutates user documents, invalidate the auth user document cache
for the affected users. This covers single-user updates as well as bulk role and user mutations.
Without it, OpenID JWT request burst caching can serve a stale `req.user` until its TTL expires.

## Development Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `npm run smart-reinstall` | Install deps (if lockfile changed) + build via Turborepo |
| `npm run reinstall` | Clean install — wipe `node_modules` and reinstall from scratch |
| `npm run backend` | Start the backend server |
| `npm run backend:dev` | Start backend with file watching (development) |
| `npm run build` | Build all compiled code via Turborepo (parallel, cached) |
| `npm run frontend` | Build all compiled code sequentially (legacy fallback) |
| `npm run frontend:dev` | Start frontend dev server with HMR (port 3090, requires backend running) |
| `npm run build:data-provider` | Rebuild `packages/data-provider` after changes |

- Node.js: v24.16.0
- Database: MongoDB
- Backend runs on `http://localhost:3080/`; frontend dev server on `http://localhost:3090/`

## Testing

- Framework: **Jest**, run per-workspace.
- Run tests from their workspace directory: `cd api && npx jest <pattern>`, `cd packages/api && npx jest <pattern>`, etc.
- Frontend tests: `__tests__` directories alongside components; use `test/layout-test-utils` for rendering.
- Cover loading, success, and error states for UI/data flows.

### Typechecking

- **A green build is not a typecheck.** `packages/api`, `packages/client` and `packages/data-schemas`
  build with `tsdown` alone, which emits without checking types. Only `packages/data-provider` runs
  `tsc` as part of its build.
- Run `npx tsc --noEmit` in the workspace you changed before calling it done. `client` also exposes
  it as `npm run typecheck`.
- `packages/client/tsconfig.json` excludes `*.spec.ts(x)` and `*.test.ts(x)`, so test files there are
  never typechecked — a type error in a spec surfaces only when the test runs.
- `npm run static-checks` runs the Static Checks CI job locally against your staged files;
  `npm run static-checks -- --against origin/dev` reproduces what CI sees for a pull request, and
  `npm run static-checks:full` adds the slow gates (TypeScript, config migration tests, unused i18n
  keys, unused npm packages).

### Philosophy

- **Real logic over mocks.** Exercise actual code paths with real dependencies. Mocking is a last resort.
- **Spies over mocks.** Assert that real functions are called with expected arguments and frequency without replacing underlying logic.
- **MongoDB**: use `mongodb-memory-server` for a real in-memory MongoDB instance. Test actual queries and schema validation, not mocked DB calls.
- **MCP**: use real `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` exports for servers, transports, and tool definitions. Mirror real scenarios, don't stub SDK internals.
- Only mock what you cannot control: external HTTP APIs, rate-limited services, non-deterministic system calls.
- Heavy mocking is a code smell, not a testing strategy.

## Formatting

Fix all formatting lint errors (trailing spaces, tabs, newlines, indentation) using auto-fix when available. All TypeScript/ESLint warnings and errors **must** be resolved.

`npm run sort-imports` with no arguments rewrites every file under `api/`, `client/src` and the four
`packages/*/src` roots — far beyond what you touched. Always pass explicit paths:
`npm run sort-imports -- path/to/file.ts`.
