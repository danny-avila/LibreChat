# Server configuration. 
##########################

# The server will listen to localhost:3080 by default. You can change the target IP as you want. 
# If you want to make this server available externally, for example to share the server with others 
# or expose this from a Docker container, set host to 0.0.0.0 or your external IP interface. 
# Tips: Setting host to 0.0.0.0 means listening on all interfaces. It's not a real IP.  
# Use localhost:port rather than 0.0.0.0:port to access the server. 
HOST=localhost
PORT=3080
NODE_ENV=development

# Change this to proxy any API request. 
# It's useful if your machine has difficulty calling the original API server. 
# PROXY=

# Change this to your MongoDB URI if different and I recommend appending chatgpt-clone 
MONGO_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/chatgpt-clone

# Search:
#############################

# ENABLING SEARCH MESSAGES/CONVOS 
# Requires the installation of the free self-hosted Meilisearch or a paid Remote Plan (Remote not tested) 
# The easiest setup for this is through docker-compose, which takes care of it for you. 
SEARCH=TRUE

# REQUIRED FOR SEARCH: MeiliSearch Host, mainly for the API server to connect to the search server. 
# Replace '0.0.0.0' with 'meilisearch' if serving MeiliSearch with docker-compose. 
MEILI_HOST=http://0.0.0.0:7700

# REQUIRED FOR SEARCH: MeiliSearch HTTP Address, mainly for docker-compose to expose the search server. 
# Replace '0.0.0.0' with 'meilisearch' if serving MeiliSearch with docker-compose. 
MEILI_HTTP_ADDR=0.0.0.0:7700

# REQUIRED FOR SEARCH: In production env., a secure key is needed. You can generate your own. 
# This master key must be at least 16 bytes, composed of valid UTF-8 characters. 
# MeiliSearch will throw an error and refuse to launch if no master key is provided, 
# or if it is under 16 bytes. MeiliSearch will suggest a secure autogenerated master key.
# Using docker, it seems recognized as production so use a secure key.
# This is a ready made secure key for docker-compose, you can replace it with your own.
