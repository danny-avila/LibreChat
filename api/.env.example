# Server configuration. 
# The server will listen to localhost:3080 request by default. You can set the target ip as you want.
# If you want this server can be used outside your local machine, for example to share with other 
# machine or expose this from a docker container, set HOST=0.0.0.0 or your external ip interface.
#
# Tips: HOST=0.0.0.0 means listening on all interface. It's not a real ip. Use localhost:port rather
# than 0.0.0.0:port to open it.
