# Server configuration: 
##########################

# The server will listen to localhost:3080 by default. You can change the target IP as you want. 
# If you want to make this server available externally, for example to share the server with others 
# or expose this from a Docker container, set host to 0.0.0.0 or your external IP interface. 
# Tips: Setting host to 0.0.0.0 means listening on all interfaces. It's not a real IP.  
# Use localhost:port rather than 0.0.0.0:port to access the server. 
# Set Node env to development if running in dev mode.
HOST=localhost
PORT=3080
NODE_ENV=production 

# Change this to proxy any API request. 
# It's useful if your machine has difficulty calling the original API server.

# Change this to your MongoDB URI if different. I recommend appending chatgpt-clone.

# To use Azure with this project, set the following variables. These will be used to build the API URL.

# You should also consider changing the `OPENAI_MODELS` variable above to the models available in your instance/deployment.
# Note: I've noticed that the Azure API is much faster than the OpenAI API, so the streaming looks almost instantaneous.

# REQUIRED FOR SEARCH: In production env., a secure key is needed. You can generate your own. 
# This master key must be at least 16 bytes, composed of valid UTF-8 characters. 
# MeiliSearch will throw an error and refuse to launch if no master key is provided, 
# or if it is under 16 bytes. MeiliSearch will suggest a secure autogenerated master key.
# Using docker, it seems recognized as production so use a secure key.
# This is a ready made secure key for docker-compose, you can replace it with your own.
