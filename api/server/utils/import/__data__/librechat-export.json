          "text": "The fuel consumption of a Volkswagen Transporter can vary based on the specific model and driving conditions. For example, the 2021 Volkswagen Transporter T6.1 L2H1 2.0 TDI 110HP, which is one of the recent models, doesn't have its fuel consumption data explicitly mentioned in the sources I found. However, a review of a Volkswagen Transporter model, which is equipped with a 2.0-litre four-cylinder turbo diesel engine and a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission, mentions a combined cycle fuel consumption figure of 8.2 litres per 100km. It's important to note that this figure might vary, especially when the vehicle is carrying eight people, as more weight can lead to increased fuel consumption.\n\nFor more detailed information, you might need to refer to the specific model's manual or contact a Volkswagen dealer. Also, keep in mind that real-world fuel consumption can be influenced by factors such as driving style, road conditions, and maintenance of the vehicle ([2021 Volkswagen Transporter T6.1 L2H1 2.0 TDI 110HP specs, dimensions](https://www.ultimatespecs.com/car-specs/Volkswagen/118424/2021-Volkswagen-Transporter-T61-L2H1-20-TDI-110HP.html)) ([Volkswagen Transporter Review - Drive](https://www.drive.com.au/reviews/volkswagen-transporter-review/)).",
