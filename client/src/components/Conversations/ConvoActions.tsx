/**
 * Owns the row's overflow control: which control is rendered, when it is
 * visible, and where focus lives across the swap between them.
 *
 * Two controls can represent this menu — `ConvoOptions`, which carries six
 * mutations and its own menu store, and a cheap placeholder that stands in
 * until the menu is wanted. Mounting the real one for every overscanned row is
 * wasteful, but the two must agree about identity, visibility, focus and
 * lifecycle, and splitting those decisions across the row is what made them
 * disagree. They are settled together here:
 *
 * - **Which.** A pointer device reveals the menu on hover, so hovering is
 *   enough to mount the real one. Touch has no hover, so the placeholder is
 *   what makes the menu discoverable at all.
 * - **When it sticks.** Once a row's menu has been opened, the real one stays.
 *   Swapping back would destroy Ariakit's button — its own final-focus target —
 *   and strand focus on the document, since the placeholder is a different
 *   node. Rows never opened still mount nothing, which is the point.
 * - **Visibility.** `ConvoOptions` reveals its trigger on hover or focus; on
 *   touch it is told to stay visible, or an interacted row keeps only an
 *   invisible hit target.
 * - **Activation.** A plain click. The browser withholds it until a press
 *   resolves as a tap rather than a scroll, and synthesises it for keyboard and
 *   assistive-technology activation — so no pointer-level handling is needed,
 *   and none should be added: claiming the press earlier is what previously
 *   opened menus mid-scroll.
