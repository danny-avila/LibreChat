/**
 * WakeLockManager Component
 *
 * Manages the Screen Wake Lock during AI response generation to prevent
 * device screens from sleeping or dimming during long-running operations.
 *
 * The wake lock is only active when:
 * 1. Any conversation is currently generating a response (anySubmittingSelector)
 * 2. User has not disabled the feature in settings (keepScreenAwake preference)
 *
 * This component is rendered at the root level of the application
 * to ensure wake lock state persists across all conversations and routes.
 *
 * @see useWakeLock - The hook that manages the actual wake lock implementation
 * @see anySubmittingSelector - Recoil selector tracking if any conversation is generating
