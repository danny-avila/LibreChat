/**
 * Card that opens a code-execution-produced artifact in the side panel.
 *
 * Three effects, separately scoped:
 *
 *  1. **Dedup claim** (`useLayoutEffect`, runs synchronously before
 *     paint). The same file can appear in multiple tool calls within a
 *     single message (e.g. the agent reads back what it just wrote) or
 *     across messages. Each card claims `toolArtifactClaim(artifact.id)`
 *     with its unique component-instance key on mount; the latest card
 *     to mount wins, so older duplicates re-render to `null`. The atom
 *     is family-keyed by artifact id, so claims for unrelated artifacts
 *     don't trigger re-renders here. Cleanup releases the claim if it's
 *     still ours so a subsequent re-mount can take it.
 *
 *  2. **Self-heal registration** subscribes to the per-id selector
 *     `artifactByIdSelector(artifact.id)` and writes only when the
 *     entry is missing or the cached content/type/title drifted. The
 *     panel's `useArtifacts` hook resets `artifactsState` on close, so
 *     this re-fires deterministically once the slice transitions back
 *     to `undefined` — without the no-deps render-loop pattern. The
 *     write is also gated on `isMyClaim`, making the registration
 *     single-writer per id: when two cards exist for the same file
 *     across turns, only the latest (claim-holder) updates state.
 *     Without that guard, both cards would observe each other's write
 *     and trade overwrites in a loop.
 *
 *  3. **Focus + open on mount** (deps: artifact.id, artifact.type) —
 *     gated on `isSubmitting` captured at first render via a ref AND
 *     on `artifact.type !== CODE`. A card mounted *during* streaming
 *     for a rich-preview bucket (HTML, React, Markdown, plain text)
 *     steals panel focus and forces `artifactsVisibility = true` so
 *     the panel auto-opens — matching the legacy SSE auto-open UX.
 *     A card mounted while `isSubmitting === false` is part of
 *     conversation history (page load, back-navigation) and must not
 *     steal focus — `Presentation`'s render condition gates on
 *     `currentArtifactId != null`, so leaving both alone keeps the
 *     panel closed on history load. The CODE bucket (`.py`, `.js`,
 *     `Dockerfile`, …) is click-to-open *even on streaming*: source
 *     files are typically supporting scripts the agent emits alongside
 *     a richer deliverable, and shoving the panel in front of the
 *     user every time a helper script gets written is disruptive.
 *     Click-to-open via `handleOpen` works for every bucket regardless
 *     of context.
