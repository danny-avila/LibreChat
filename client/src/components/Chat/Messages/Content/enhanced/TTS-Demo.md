# TTS (Text-to-Speech) Implementation Demo

## Overview
This document demonstrates the completed TTS functionality for the enhanced content rendering system.

## Components Implemented

### 1. TTSEngine Class
- **Location**: `TTSEngine.ts`
- **Purpose**: Core TTS functionality using Web Speech API
- **Features**:
  - Singleton pattern for global state management
  - Language-specific voice selection
  - Speech queue management (stops previous speech when starting new)
  - Browser compatibility detection
  - Language validation with fallback to system default (pl-PL)
  - State management with callbacks for UI updates
  - Error handling for speech synthesis failures

### 2. TTSRenderer Component
- **Location**: `TTSRenderer.tsx`
- **Purpose**: React component for rendering clickable TTS elements
- **Features**:
  - Clickable text with speaker icon
  - Visual feedback during speech (highlighting, animations)
  - Loading states and error handling
  - Keyboard accessibility (Enter/Space activation)
  - ARIA labels and screen reader support
  - Mobile-optimized touch targets

### 3. Enhanced CSS Styles
- **Location**: `enhanced-content.css`
- **Features**:
  - Responsive design for mobile/tablet/desktop
  - Hover states and animations
  - Accessibility features (focus indicators, high contrast support)
  - Reduced motion support
  - Touch-friendly sizing on mobile

## Usage Example

### Agent Message with TTS
```
Hello! [tts:en-US]Welcome to LibreChat[/tts]. 
You can also hear this in Polish: [tts:pl-PL]Witamy w LibreChat[/tts].
```

### Parsed Content Blocks
The ContentParser will create:
1. Text block: "Hello! "
2. TTS block: content="Welcome to LibreChat", language="en-US"
3. Text block: ". You can also hear this in Polish: "
4. TTS block: content="Witamy w LibreChat", language="pl-PL"
5. Text block: "."

### Rendered Output
- Regular text displays normally
- TTS text appears with hover effects and speaker icon
- Clicking text or icon triggers speech synthesis
- Visual feedback shows during playback
- Language resets to system default after completion

## Technical Features

### Browser Compatibility
- Detects Web Speech API support
- Graceful fallback when TTS not available
- Voice selection prefers local voices over remote

### Accessibility
- ARIA labels for screen readers
- Keyboard navigation support
- Focus management
- Live regions for error announcements
- High contrast mode support

### Performance
- Lazy loading of TTS engine
- Efficient state management
- Memory cleanup on component unmount
- Concurrent speech management (stops previous when starting new)

### Security
- Language code validation
- Input sanitization
- No arbitrary code execution

## Requirements Fulfilled

✅ **2.1**: TTS markup parsing with language codes  
✅ **2.2**: Clickable text elements with speaker icons  
✅ **2.3**: Language-specific voice selection  
✅ **2.4**: Visual feedback during speech playback  
✅ **2.5**: Speech queue management for concurrent requests  
✅ **2.6**: Language reset to system default after completion  
✅ **2.7**: Fallback for invalid language codes  

## Integration

The TTS functionality is fully integrated with:
- ContentParser for markup recognition
- ContentBlockRenderer for component routing
- Enhanced CSS for styling
- Type definitions for TypeScript support

## Testing

Comprehensive test suites created:
- `TTSEngine.test.ts`: Unit tests for core TTS functionality
- `TTSRenderer.test.tsx`: Component tests for UI interactions
- `TTS.integration.test.tsx`: Integration tests for full workflow

## Next Steps

The TTS functionality is complete and ready for use. Users can now:
1. Include TTS markup in agent responses
2. Click on TTS elements to hear pronunciation
3. Experience visual feedback during playback
4. Use keyboard navigation for accessibility
5. Enjoy responsive design across all devices

The implementation follows all security best practices and accessibility guidelines while providing a smooth user experience.
