 * Puts an automatic occurrence's chat in the sidebar, the same way Run Now does.
 *
 * An automatic occurrence is the one generation nothing in this client starts, so
 * no submission, stream or event handler ever tells the sidebar its chat exists —
 * and the list's own five-minute staleness leaves it out of a tab that stays
 * focused. This panel's query is already polling for the cards, and it names the
 * chat each generating occurrence is producing, read from the run's own row rather
 * than inferred from the schedule. Every one is handed to the admission watch Run
 * Now uses, on every observation: that watch is the one place that decides whether
 * an id is landed, in flight, or — having given up on a delivery deferred past its
 * budget — worth trying again. When an occurrence leaves the list it is released,
 * so the watch remembers a run only for as long as this keeps announcing it.
 *
 * `observedAt` is what makes "every observation" true. React Query keeps the
 * previous reference when a refetch is deep-equal, which is exactly what a poll
 * returns while a run stays in flight, so an effect keyed on the data alone would
 * never run again — and a watch that gave up would never be asked to try again.
 *
 * When a run's state moves — one settles, its schedule is deleted from under it,
 * or a schedule created elsewhere arrives with a run already behind it — the list
 * is re-read once for the chat, order and title the settlement changed. Because
 * the state includes the generating occurrences, an owner editing the schedule
 * mid-flight (which fences the `lastRun` projection) still cannot hide a
 * settlement. The first observation has nothing earlier to compare against, so it
 * re-reads if any schedule has run at all: the sidebar may have been read before
 * that run, and nothing here can tell — one refetch on opening the panel is the
 * honest price of that.
