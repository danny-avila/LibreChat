 * The trailing control on a list row: the conversation overflow menu and every
 * action that sits where it sits, in the bookmark, memory, MCP, prompt and
 * project lists.
 *
 * One recipe because a row action is one idea. Each list had grown its own
 * version, and they disagreed about size, hover fill and when the control was
 * even visible, so the same gesture looked different depending on which list
 * the pointer was over.
 *
 * `open` keeps the control lit and visible while the menu or dialog it owns is
 * open: the pointer has left the row for the popup by then, and a trigger that
 * vanishes underneath an open menu reads as a different control on the way
 * back.
 *
 * `visible` is for a row that already stands out on its own, such as the active
 * conversation, where the action should not wait to be found.
