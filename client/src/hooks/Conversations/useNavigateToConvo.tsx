/**

 * that still calls `navigate()` after an await: it captures the route before
 * its request and re-reads it before moving the user, so a record that lands
 * for a conversation the user has already left cannot pull them back. The
 * browser's own location is the only thing that sees EVERY way they can leave
 * — a different sidebar row, "New chat", a link, a redirect, or the back
 * button — where any bookkeeping this hook maintained itself would only cover
 * the navigations that happen to route through it.
 *
 * The query string counts: `/c/new?projectId=A` is a different conversation
 * scope than `/c/new`, and the chip that changes it writes the draft in place
 * without ever going through a conversation hook — so a pathname-only
 * comparison would let a pending record land on a draft the user had just
 * re-scoped.
 *
 * Read directly rather than through `useLocation` because each sidebar row
 * mounts its own `useNavigateToConvo`: subscribing would re-render every row on
 * every navigation, which is the cost this hook exists to avoid. Comparing a
 * location against a location also makes the router basename cancel out.

 * other: that path deliberately leaves the route where it is until the record
 * arrives, so both captures read the same pathname and whichever request the
 * network answered first would win. The two guards are orthogonal and neither
 * subsumes the other — the generation says "a newer intent replaced this one",
 * the route says "the user left by some means this hook never saw".
 *
 * Module-scoped for the same reason the route is read from the browser: every
