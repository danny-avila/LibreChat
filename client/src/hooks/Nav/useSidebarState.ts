 * The persisted value is normalized when the atom initializes, which covers
 * loading straight onto a phone. Crossing the breakpoint afterwards — narrowing
 * a window, rotating a tablet — has no such moment, and an expanded desktop
 * sidebar would become a drawer covering the whole app.
 *
 * Correcting that in an effect would still paint one frame with the drawer open
 * and the conversation translated fully offscreen, then animate both back over
 * 300ms. So the closed state is *derived during the transition render* and the
 * effect only commits it. Both the drawer and the content pane read through
 * here so they can never disagree about that frame.
