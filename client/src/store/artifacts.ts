/**
 * Per-artifact-id claim used by `ToolArtifactCard` to dedup the same file
 * across tool calls / messages. Holds the unique component-instance key
 * of whichever card most recently mounted for that id; cards whose key
 * doesn't match return `null` so the same chip doesn't render twice.
 *
 * Keyed by `artifact.id` (which is `tool-artifact-${file_id}`), so each
 * card subscribes only to its own slice — adding or removing a claim
 * for one artifact never re-renders cards for unrelated artifacts.
 *
 * Lifetime: atom entries remain in the family map even after a card
 * unmounts (Recoil doesn't GC `atomFamily` entries). Card unmount
 * resets the value to `null`, so the residual cost per artifact is one
 * key + a `null` value — negligible at typical session scale (dozens
 * of files per conversation). If this ever becomes a memory concern
 * we can fold the family into a single `Record` atom and reset it from
 * `useArtifacts`'s conversation-change cleanup.

 * when the artifact's content meaningfully changes — instead of firing
 * on every parent render via a no-deps `useEffect`.

/**
 * One-shot signal that an attachment's deferred preview just transitioned
 * from `pending` to `ready` during the current session — keyed by
 * `file_id` (raw, NOT the `tool-artifact-${file_id}` form).
 *
 * The preview-sync hook flips this to `true` on the pending→ready edge.
 * `ToolArtifactCard` reads it on mount; if set, it auto-opens the panel
 * (even when no submission is in flight) and then resets the flag, so
 * subsequent re-mounts (panel close/reopen, re-render of the same card
 * from history) do not steal focus a second time.
 *
 * Why a separate signal rather than reusing `mountedDuringStreamRef`:
 * the deferred render can complete *after* the SSE stream has closed,
 * so the card mounts with `isSubmitting === false` and the existing
 * focus/open path skips. Without this signal, a freshly resolved
 * artifact would render in place but not auto-open — which is exactly
 * the bug the deferred-preview flow was designed to mask in the first
 * place. Auto-open ONLY on the pending→ready edge means a user
 * scrolling through history doesn't get the panel popping open every
 * time a previously resolved chip enters the viewport.
