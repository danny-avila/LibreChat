export default Spring;
/**
 * Provides a model of a classical spring acting to
 * resolve a body to equilibrium. Springs have configurable
 * tension which is a force multipler on the displacement of the
 * spring from its rest point or `endValue` as defined by [Hooke's
 * law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooke's_law). Springs also have
 * configurable friction, which ensures that they do not oscillate
 * infinitely. When a Spring is displaced by updating it's resting
 * or `currentValue`, the SpringSystems that contain that Spring
 * will automatically start looping to solve for equilibrium. As each
 * timestep passes, `SpringListener` objects attached to the Spring
 * will be notified of the updates providing a way to drive an
 * animation off of the spring's resolution curve.
