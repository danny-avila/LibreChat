# Serial database latency Lighthouse CI

Run from the repository root with Node 24 and Chrome installed:

```sh
npm ci
E2E_CHROMIUM_CHANNEL=chrome npm run lighthouse
# Reuse the production build:
E2E_CHROMIUM_CHANNEL=chrome npm run lighthouse:run
# Negative control: this MUST exit nonzero with an LCP assertion failure:
E2E_CHROMIUM_CHANNEL=chrome npm run lighthouse:regression
```

`E2E_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3098` selects another local port. Each run starts a
disposable MongoDB and the real Express server, registers a local user, and seeds
a conversation. No model inference is needed. Do not point this test at a deployed
service. Playwright refuses to reuse an existing server.

The existing `benchmarks/mongoose-latency-hook.cjs` adds **250 ms per Mongoose
Query/Aggregate execution** in the server process. Independent queries can overlap;
serial queries compound. This is a deterministic approximation of remote database
latency, not a replica topology or network emulator. It also delays query-based
writes; native driver calls, bulk operations and cursor batches are outside its
coverage. Use a TCP latency proxy if those paths need coverage.

Lighthouse CI makes three cold browser navigations to a populated conversation,
using the production client build and real authentication, config, file and message
routes. It uses desktop settings with `throttlingMethod: provided` so Lighthouse
does not replace the measured server delays with simulated network timing.
Median budgets are LCP **4,500 ms**, CLS **0.1**, and TBT **500 ms**. These are lab
regression budgets, not field web-vitals percentiles; Lighthouse does not measure INP.
The test also requires the seeded transcript to be the LCP element, so a fast
login page, spinner, or empty shell cannot pass.

## When the gate fails

1. Read the failed audit's actual value and limit in the job log or
   `.lighthouseci/assertion-results.json`.
2. Open a `.lighthouseci/lhr-*.html` report. The console also prints API request
   start/end times. A late request start suggests a browser dependency; a long
   request suggests server work or serial database reads.
3. Inspect the relevant path before changing the budget:

Reuse already-loaded user/config data. Start independent reads together, but keep
every read scoped to the authenticated user/tenant and wait for authorization
before returning data. Do not raise a threshold to hide added round trips.

## Adding another scenario

`auditPage({ url, cookies, configPath })` in `audit.ts` collects the reports,
redacts authentication headers, prints API timings and enforces the selected LHCI
budgets. It returns the reports so each scenario can assert its expected final
URL and LCP content. `load.spec.ts` owns local login state, conversation seeding
and transcript assertions; the runner does not depend on them.

A downstream fork can import this runner from a separate launch spec, supply
cookies from its own authentication fixture and use a separate LHCI config for
launch budgets. The database delay hook can be preloaded by that fixture's server
configuration. Keep provider-specific authentication and provisioning in that spec.
For launch flows that navigate across documents, also measure entry-to-ready time
with Playwright: LCP resets on a new document, so final-page LCP alone does not
cover the entire launch. This lane does not exercise OpenID/Redis cache priming.

`lighthouse:regression` preloads a test-only hook that adds 16 real, sequential
user reads before message retrieval (at least four extra seconds). It uses the
same page and LHCI assertions, and never modifies production source. Confirm
that `largest-contentful-paint` fails, rather than treating any process error as
proof. Run the normal command again to restore baseline reports. Reports stay
local or in GitHub job artifacts; session cookie values are redacted before upload.
Same-repository pull requests also receive the last 80 log lines as a failure comment.
