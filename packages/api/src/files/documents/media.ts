 * has nothing for OCR to read. EPUB has no fixed place at all. Matching the extension
 * answers both: it finds an EPUB image wherever the manifest put it, and it leaves
 * `ppt/media/media1.mp4` alone. EMF and WMF are included because Office routinely wraps
 * a scanned page in one. SVG is included because it often carries the only extra text
 * in an otherwise selectable document, and AnyDoc does not read that text.

/**
 * Whether a document may embed artwork whose content a text converter cannot read.
 *
 * AnyDoc returns Markdown with no page accounting, so a deck of scanned slides comes
 * back looking as complete as one with no images at all. This is the missing-content
 * signal that lets the upload path escalate to a configured OCR service, and its
 * contract is deliberately "may", not "does": a false negative silently loses a
 * scanned page, while a false positive costs one OCR call on a document that had
 * nothing to recover.
 *
 * Each container is answered as precisely as it can be:
 *
 * - Zip-backed (OOXML, ODF, EPUB): the central directory is walked for image entries by
 *   extension. No decompression, and a malformed archive reports `false` because the
 *   zip-bomb guard owns rejection and the parser owns the read error.
 * - RTF: plain text, so the `\pict` control word answers it exactly.
 * - Legacy Office (`.doc`, `.xls`, `.ppt`): pictures live in Escher records inside a
 *   Compound File stream with no addressable name, and no cheap read distinguishes a
 *   scanned page from a document with none. Reported as media so these keep reaching
 *   a configured OCR service, which is what they did before local parsing existed.
 * - Everything else (CSV and other flat text): nothing to embed, so `false`.
