 * otherwise hold that slot indefinitely:
 *
 * - A RETAINED TERMINAL JOB. The generation finished, but its owner's Mongo outcome write
 *   exhausted every retry (`recordScheduleOutcome` returns false) and left the preserved
 *   job as the only surviving evidence. The armed engine's reconciler replays exactly
 *   this; with no engine nothing did, so the run stayed `started` and its retained
 *   generation evidence lived until store expiry.
 * - AN UNPROJECTED PAUSE. The generation paused for approval, but the owner's
 *   `requires_action` projection failed every retry, so the row never left `started` even
 *   though the pause itself is durable in the job.
 * - A DEAD DELIVERY. A pre-generation rejection (interactive limiter, PII, moderation)
 *   dead-letters the delivery while the run stays `started` with no job at all.
 *
 * Both are safe in EVERY topology because both read positive, durable evidence instead of
 * inferring owner death from absence: an identity-matched job is authoritative wherever it
 * is observed (a shared store shows the real generation; a process-local store can only be
 * showing this process's own), and a `dead` delivery is shared state proving no generation
 * owns the reservation. This never claims, fires, or advances, and defers anything fenced
 * by an in-flight abort or resume hand-off. Auto-disable policy is deliberately NOT applied
 * (the armed engine owns that): the run settles and frees its slot, the streak is untouched.
