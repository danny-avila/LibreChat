# Unattended MCP support

Scheduled chats validate the selected agent and its accessible graph agents before creation,
when enabling or changing the agent, and before each automatic or manual dispatch.
The check uses the persisted user document and plugin credentials, with temporary
user connections that are disposed afterwards. It does not borrow a browser session
or replace a live interactive connection. Graph agents are loaded in breadth-first
batches, and private children are skipped with the same VIEW rule as a live run.
Enabled spawn-agent members are included when the endpoint grants that capability.
The effective endpoint must grant the tools capability. Tool discovery uses the configured
per-admission concurrency (one to ten, default three), must complete, and must contain all
explicitly selected tools; wildcard selections require a nonempty catalog. Request disconnects
and scheduler shutdown cancel connection setup and discovery without advancing the occurrence.
Readiness admissions use a separate bounded pool and complete before a durable generation
slot is reserved, so slow MCP servers cannot consume generation capacity or block later
healthy occurrences from being considered.

Supported authentication is determined by a successful unattended connection:

- Static server credentials and anonymous servers.
- Persisted custom user variables, including API keys.
- Stored MCP OAuth credentials that can connect or refresh without user interaction.

Browser-only credentials, interactive OpenID bearer sources without a stored
refresh token, missing user variables, and OAuth grants needing renewed consent
cannot be assumed available. When `interface.schedules.unattendedOpenIDTokens`
is enabled and `OPENID_REUSE_TOKENS` is on, login and interactive refresh persist
an encrypted OpenID refresh token for the schedule owner. Scheduled preflight and
execution then redeem that token through the default
`HostUpstreamTokenProviderResolver`. The owner must sign in once after the toggle
is enabled. Reconnect or configure the server in an interactive agent chat, or
remove it from the agent, then enable the schedule. A browser connection alone
does not prove readiness; enabling always reruns the unattended check.

`mcp_reauth_required`, `mcp_configuration_missing`, and `mcp_permission_denied` stop a
scheduled occurrence and disable the schedule immediately. The permission status tells
the owner that an administrator must restore MCP use access. `mcp_unavailable` counts
toward the existing configured consecutive-failure threshold. Credential-store and
configuration-store outages are transient; they must never be treated as proof of missing credentials.
Failure records contain only server names and resolution statuses, never exception
messages or OAuth URLs. Successful dispatch records also retain the server outcomes.

The schedule card shows failed servers and links to the selected agent for recovery.
A pure pause remains available even when MCP validation fails. This change does not
re-enable existing schedules automatically or repair credentials on the user's behalf.

## Host token-provider context

`createMCPPreflight` and `createInitializeClient` accept a
`HostUpstreamTokenProviderResolver`. The default application installs one that
loads the owner's stored OpenID refresh token when
`interface.schedules.unattendedOpenIDTokens` is true. Hosts may still replace it.
The host receives the persisted/authenticated user and these optional fields:

```ts
resolveUpstreamTokenProvider(user, {
  signal,
  context: { scheduleId, ownerId, tenantId, agentId, invocationMode: 'delegated' },
  target: { mcpServer, scopes },
});
```

Admission allocates a proposed schedule ID before preflight and persists that same ID
only if creation succeeds. Preflight is validation, not a provisioning/consent hook:
hosts must not create durable grants keyed by this proposed ID. Failed admission or a
concurrent idempotency-key winner can discard it. Edits
and dispatch use the existing schedule ID. Execution derives the context from the
verified schedule trigger and authenticated owner, then captures it before tool loading.
`agentId` identifies the root scheduled agent throughout child execution and handoffs.
After an approval pause, the resume host restores the context from the saved job after
validating ownership, tenancy, agent identity, and schedule liveness. An explicit initializer
argument carries this restored context; resume body fields cannot replace it.
The existing resolver closure is passed through tool discovery, execution, and reconnects;
it never goes into tool arguments or durable job payloads.

Each OBO consumer supplies its server name and configured scopes after its existing trust
check. A run shares in-flight lookups and successful providers only for identical server
and scope pairs. Failed or empty lookups may retry; cancellation belongs to the owning run,
so cancelling one child does not cancel a sibling's lookup.

`tenantId` is absent in deployments without tenancy. `context` is absent for legacy callers
that supply no schedule ID or verified trigger, and `target` is absent for legacy consumers.
Existing callbacks may ignore the new fields. Hosts needing either field must reject its
absence. Context describes execution; it is not a consent grant or permission to mint.
Current schedules execute with their owner's authority, hence `delegated`. Dedicated agent
authorization requires a separate implementation. Scopes are not an STS audience; audience
mapping and authorization remain the host's responsibility.

The injection interface itself adds no STS exchange, consent API, or new MCP
credential mode. The default application optionally persists encrypted OpenID
refresh tokens in the existing Token collection (`openid_offline`) so scheduled
OBO can refresh without a live browser session.
