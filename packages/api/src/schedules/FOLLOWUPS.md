# Scheduled chats: deferred scope

Scheduled chats remain experimental and default-off.

## Must-have product follow-ups

- Add one-time and monthly schedules; current cadences are hourly, daily, weekdays, and weekly.
- Add non-agent chat targets and existing-conversation continuation; current schedules require
  `agent_id` and always target `new`.

## Client/API parity

- Return `minIntervalMinutes` in schedule limits and surface it in the dialog.
- Add active-run and run-history discovery. The list response currently projects only `lastRun`,
  which is written on pause, skip, or terminal outcomes, so the client's `started` chip is
  unreachable.
- Add multi-day weekly, timezone, and attachment controls. The API supports these, but the dialog
  does not. NOTE: the dialog cannot scroll from `md` up (`md:overflow-visible` exists because the
  Ariakit popovers cannot portal out of the focus-trapping Radix dialog), so its content must fit
  the viewport — roughly 30px of slack remain at 1280x720. Each of these controls adds a row and
  will push the footer's Save button out of reach. Adding them needs the height problem solved
  first: give `ControlCombobox` the `portalElement` prop `Dropdown` already has, portal the
  popovers into the dialog content element, and let the form scroll again.

## Known gaps: project scope

- A project deleted inside the window between the resume controller's
  `isScheduleLive(..., { policy: true })` check and `claimScheduleResume` is not caught:
  deletion bumps no revision, so the lease fence cannot see it and the continuation
  starts against a conversation that was just unscoped. Sub-second, and self-correcting
  at the next fire (which auto-disables the schedule). Closing it needs a distinct
  policy conflict returned from the claim that the controller routes through
  abort-and-settle, rather than the bare 409 an `inactive` conflict produces today.
- The stored project converges on an operator pin only when the schedule actually
  FIRES. A schedule that has not fired since the pin moved still carries its old id,
  which the wire projection already papers over but a direct read of the row does not.
  Resume validation is unaffected — it reads the occurrence's own record.

## Runtime scope

- The standard server supports multi-replica scheduling only with a confirmed Redis-backed
  `GenerationJobManager`; in-memory mode requires `SCHEDULES_SINGLE_PROCESS`. The legacy
  `experimental.js` clustered entrypoint does not arm the engine and rejects schedule writes.
- Deferred account deletion blocks new remote API admission but cannot yet drain already-admitted
  OpenAI-compatible or Responses requests; see
  [#14594](https://github.com/danny-avila/LibreChat/issues/14594).

## Test debt

- Add Playwright coverage for creating a schedule through the UI. The execution E2E currently
  seeds schedules through the API.
