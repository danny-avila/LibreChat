 *   - `undefined`, which lets the SDK install its own in-process `MemorySaver`
 *     (single-process / dev, or whenever Mongo isn't ready yet).
 *
 * Storage is bounded two ways: a Mongo TTL index reclaims runs that are never
 * resolved ({@link DEFAULT_CHECKPOINT_TTL_SECONDS}), and {@link deleteAgentCheckpoint}
 * prunes a thread's checkpoints after ordinary terminal transitions. Approval
 * expiry relies on the TTL because a thread-wide eager delete can race a replacement run.

/**
 * A `MongoDBSaver` that persists ONLY checkpoints carrying a {@link hasResumableWrite resumable}
 * pending write — an interrupt (a HITL pause) or a real-channel/delta anchor — and discards both
 * the no-write checkpoint LangGraph writes on a CLEAN exit and the bookkeeping-only checkpoint of
 * a failed (non-paused) turn.
 *
 * **Why.** With `durability: 'exit'` (set by the SDK whenever a checkpointer is active) the
 * graph persists exactly one checkpoint at the exit boundary on EVERY run — paused or not.
 * A non-paused turn therefore writes a dead checkpoint whose only fate is to be pruned by
 * {@link deleteAgentCheckpoint}. HITL only ever resumes a checkpoint that has pending writes,
 * so the clean (write-less) exit checkpoint is pure write+delete churn on the common path.
 * This saver skips it.
 *
 * **How it tells them apart** (verified empirically with throwaway runnable probes against
 * `@langchain/langgraph@1.4`, not source-reading): under `durability: 'exit'` LangGraph
 * calls `putWrites` for a checkpoint BEFORE the `put` that creates it, with `config.checkpoint_id`
 * equal to that `put`'s `checkpoint.id`. An interrupt records an `INTERRUPT` ("__interrupt__")
 * write; a delta-channel graph records its delta writes on a real (non-`__`-prefixed) channel.
 * A CLEAN exit produces a checkpoint with NO pending writes. So we record the checkpoint id of
 * each `putWrites` that carries a {@link hasResumableWrite resumable} write and persist a `put`
 * only when its `checkpoint.id` was so marked — which keeps interrupt checkpoints AND any
 * real-channel/delta anchors (resume can walk the chain), while dropping the write-less clean
 * exit. Keying on the globally-unique checkpoint id (NOT thread_id) stays correct even when two
 * runs race on the same conversation (`thread_id`).
 *
 * **Bookkeeping batches follow their checkpoint's fate.** Only a {@link hasResumableWrite
 * resumable} batch ANCHORS a checkpoint (justifies persisting it); a bookkeeping-only batch
 * (`__error__`, `__no_writes__`, a lone `__resume__`, …) never does — but whether its ROWS matter
 * depends on whether the checkpoint survives, which `put` decides later. Probe-confirmed both
 * ways: a failed non-paused turn emits `putWrites([__error__])` + `put` — persisting either half
 * would leak (an orphan row or a dead checkpoint) — while a paused Send fan-out records completed
 * siblings as `__no_writes__` markers on the RETAINED interrupt checkpoint, and dropping those
 * re-executes the siblings on resume (duplicated side effects). So bookkeeping batches are
 * BUFFERED in memory until the fate is known: forwarded once the checkpoint is anchored (or was
 * just persisted), dropped when its `put` discards it. Net effect: an errored turn still leaves
 * NOTHING durable (0 checkpoints, 0 write rows), and a retained checkpoint keeps EVERY pending
 * write LangGraph recorded for it — byte-for-byte what a plain `MongoDBSaver` would store.
 *
 * For LibreChat's agent graph (standard `Annotation`/`MessagesAnnotation` channels, no
 * `DeltaChannel` — grep-confirmed in `@librechat/agents`) a clean run makes no `putWrites` at all,
 * so this is effectively interrupt-only and the common path writes nothing; the broader
 * real-channel rule just keeps it honest for delta graphs.
 *
 * **Invariant.** Correctness depends on `durability: 'exit'` (which the SDK sets whenever a
 * checkpointer is active): exactly one parentless boundary checkpoint per run, with its
 * `putWrites` ordered before its `put`. Under per-step durability LangGraph instead emits
 * `put`-before-`putWrites` for chained checkpoints — the anchor would arrive too late and a
 * checkpoint could be wrongly discarded. The SDK never runs HITL that way; if that ever changes,
 * this saver must be revisited (a parent-based guard is NOT viable — a resumed turn's clean
 * completion is itself a parented, write-less checkpoint that we correctly discard).
 *
 * **Correctness.** Checkpoints with resumable writes (interrupt + real-channel/delta anchor) and
 * the writes themselves persist exactly as before, so resume is unchanged. The write-less clean
 * checkpoint (and the now-discarded error-only checkpoint) was only ever written-then-pruned, so
 * not writing it is observationally equivalent; the pre-run prune + Mongo TTL remain the
 * backstops. The saver overrides every config-bearing read/write path to apply
 * generation storage scoping; `deleteThread` and `setup` remain inherited.
