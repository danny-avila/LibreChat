 * Accepts only string[] in practice: filters out non-string elements,
 * empty strings, and pathologically long names so a crafted payload
 * (numbers, objects, nulls, giga-strings) can't reach `getSkillByName`
 * and waste DB round-trips, matching the TypeScript contract
 * (`manualSkills?: string[]` on TPayload). Returns `undefined` for
 * missing / non-array inputs OR for arrays that contain no valid strings —
 * callers treat undefined as "no manual invocation this turn."
