/**
 * The import engine's public surface.
 *
 * Named rather than `export *`: `@librechat/api` is a published package, so a
 * barrel re-export freezes every internal helper — archive readers, manifest
 * resolution, the tree repair, the asset ingester — into an API that external
 * consumers can depend on and this package then has to keep. Everything below
 * is consumed by `/api`; anything else is deliberately internal.
