 * Every URL in an archive is attacker-controlled, and the citation renderers
 * put them straight into `href`/`src` (`Web/Sources.tsx`, `SourceHovercard`,
 * `Citation`) with no transform of their own. React 18 still emits
 * `javascript:` URLs — it only warns — and a shared conversation carries its
 * search results verbatim to every viewer (`SENSITIVE_SHARED_FILE_FIELDS`
 * deliberately preserves them), so an unfiltered link is stored XSS against
 * whoever opens the share.
 *
 * The filter lives here, where the source is built, rather than at each sink:
 * a dropped URL means one missing citation, where a dropped sink means a live
 * vulnerability.
