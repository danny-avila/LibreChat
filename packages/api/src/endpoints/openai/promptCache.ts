 * Either way the digest is derived, not registered: a real change to the
 * instructions, tool schemas, output schema or API mode produces a new
 * identity with no explicit invalidation step, so a stale prefix can never be
 * reused under a key that no longer describes it.
 *
 * What it does *not* name is the exact tool list of one turn. Deferred tools
 * enter the binding when a conversation discovers them, and the dynamic system
 * tail is rebuilt every turn; both are excluded above with their reasons,
 * because a key that followed them would give every conversation its own
 * entry and there would be nothing left to reuse.
