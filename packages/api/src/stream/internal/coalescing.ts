 * manager with non-batching services or batching services with a silent
 * manager. Both sides MUST also buffer on the same window: the subscriber
 * resume frontier assumes an event is never visible in the durable chunk log
 * meaningfully earlier than its sequence lands on the shared counter, so
 * batching one side without the other reopens that race for the full window
 * instead of a same-tick skew. 0 (the default) disables coalescing.
