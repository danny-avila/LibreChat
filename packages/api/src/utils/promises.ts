/**
 * Resolves with `promise`, but rejects as soon as `signal` aborts.
 *
 * Unlike handing the signal to the work itself, the underlying promise keeps
 * running. Use it for shared work whose lifetime outlives this caller — an OAuth
 * flow keyed by user and action that a concurrent run may also be awaiting and
 * that a browser callback will complete. Cancelling such work on one waiter's
 * abort strands the others and discards an authorization the user has already
 * granted; leaving the caller attached is equally wrong, because the value
 * arrives after the user pressed Stop and the caller acts on it.
 *
 * The detached promise's later settlement is swallowed rather than surfacing as
 * an unhandled rejection.
