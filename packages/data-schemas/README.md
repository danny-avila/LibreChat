# `@librechat/data-schemas`

Mongoose schemas and models for LibreChat. This package provides a comprehensive collection of Mongoose schemas used across the LibreChat project, enabling robust data modeling and validation for various entities such as actions, agents, messages, users, and more.


## Features

- **Modular Schemas:** Includes schemas for actions, agents, assistants, balance, banners, categories, conversation tags, conversations, files, keys, messages, plugin authentication, presets, projects, prompts, prompt groups, roles, sessions, shared links, tokens, tool calls, transactions, and users.
- **TypeScript Support:** Provides TypeScript definitions for type-safe development.
- **Ready for Mongoose Integration:** Easily integrate with Mongoose to create models and interact with your MongoDB database.
- **Flexible & Extensible:** Designed to support the evolving needs of LibreChat while being adaptable to other projects.


## Installation

Install the package via npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install @librechat/data-schemas
```

Or with yarn:

```bash
yarn add @librechat/data-schemas
```


## Usage

After installation, you can import and use the schemas in your project. For example, to create a Mongoose model for a user:

```js
import mongoose from 'mongoose';
import { userSchema } from '@librechat/data-schemas';

const UserModel = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);

// Now you can use UserModel to create, read, update, and delete user documents.
```

You can also import other schemas as needed:

```js
import { actionSchema, agentSchema, messageSchema } from '@librechat/data-schemas';
```

Each schema is designed to integrate seamlessly with Mongoose and provides indexes, timestamps, and validations tailored for LibreChatâ€™s use cases.
