# Amazon DocumentDB Compatibility Assessment (issue #14488)

> **Update 2026-08-30 — adjudicated live.** Everything below was originally
> decided from AWS's documentation, which omits unsupported operators rather
> than listing them. It has now been run against a real DocumentDB **5.0.0**
> cluster (the version this project supports, and the one the reference
> deployment runs). `audit.documentdb.spec.ts` records the verdicts; the
> corrections are in "Live verdicts" at the end of this document. Two claims
> below were wrong: pipeline-form updates had returned in new code, and the
> transaction probe reported a false negative.

Adjudicated against official AWS documentation on 2026-07-28. Engine columns
throughout: DocumentDB **3.6 / 4.0 / 5.0 / 8.0 instance-based** and **elastic
clusters**. AWS's supported-APIs page states that unsupported operators are
_omitted_ from its tables, so several verdicts below are implicit-by-omission
and flagged as such.

## Executive summary

- The login blocker was real: three aggregation-pipeline updates (one using
  `$$NOW`) existed in the codebase. DocumentDB documents no support for
  pipeline-form updates on any engine version. All three are now rewritten
  with plain update operators that work on every engine, including elastic.
- Partial-index creation fails on DocumentDB < 5.0 and elastic — and the
  failure was **provably silent** (no log, no crash, uniqueness quietly
  unenforced). Model creation now attaches an `index` listener so failed
  builds log loudly.
- Transactions already degrade gracefully via a runtime probe. GridFS is
  unreachable dead code. `retryWrites=false` is a deployment-docs item.
- Recommendation: **DocumentDB 5.0+ instance-based is a supportable target**;
  4.0 runs but with degraded uniqueness enforcement (now logged); **elastic
  clusters should be documented as unsupported** (no unique indexes at all).

## Proven incompatibilities — fixed in this PR

### 1. `acceptTerms` pipeline update + `$$NOW` (P0 — blocked login)

`packages/data-schemas/src/methods/user.ts:303` used a pipeline-form
`findByIdAndUpdate` with `$ifNull`/`$$NOW` (introduced by PR #10810, matching
the reporter's regression window). When Terms gating is on, every login hits
this and DocumentDB rejects it.

AWS evidence: the [supported APIs page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/documentdb/latest/developerguide/mongo-apis.html)
lists only classic update operators (no pipeline form anywhere); the `$set`/
`$unset` _stage_ operators are marked unsupported for 3.6/4.0/5.0; `$$NOW` is
absent from the System variables table entirely (`$$CURRENT` and `$$REMOVE`
are explicitly "No"). Implicit-by-omission, but consistent with the reported
`Failed to parse update: field must be of BSON type object` class of error
(AWS documents no exact error string).

Fix: null-guarded first-acceptance claim (`termsAcceptedAt: null` matches both
the schema's explicit `null` default and missing legacy fields — a
`$exists: false` guard would never fire because of that default), with a
plain-`$set` fallback for repeat acceptance. First-acceptance timestamp
preservation, concurrency convergence, and the `IUser | null` contract are
covered by tests, including a raw-inserted legacy document without the field.

### 2. `decrementTagCounts` pipeline update (P1 — silent tag-count drift)

`packages/data-schemas/src/methods/conversationTag.ts:47` used a
`$max`/`$subtract`/`$ifNull` pipeline inside `bulkWrite`, wrapped in a
try/catch that only logs — on DocumentDB, conversation deletion succeeded
while tag counts silently drifted.

Fix: two mutually exclusive plain ops per tag in one ordered `bulkWrite` —
clamp-to-zero (`count` below the decrement amount, or null/missing) first,
then a guarded `$inc`. Clamp-at-zero, missing-count tolerance, and
variable-amount semantics all preserved; now covered by a new test block
(previously untested).

### 3. `extendFilesTTL` pipeline update (P1 — `/files/usage` TTL holds fail)

`packages/data-schemas/src/methods/file.ts:607` — **not in the reporter's
list; found by sweeping the codebase** (`rg` for pipeline-shaped update args
and `$$NOW`; these three sites were the only hits).

Fix: read the candidate files (one projected query), compute each file's
`min(now + renewMs, createdAt + maxLifetimeMs)` ceiling client-side, then
issue per-document guarded `$set`s (`expiresAt: { $exists: true, $lt: next }`)
through `tenantSafeBulkWrite`. Only-widens, per-file ceiling, and
cleared-TTL-stays-permanent semantics are preserved under concurrency by the
write guard. Cost: one extra read round trip on this path — unavoidable
without a schema change, because the ceiling is per-document.

## Proven, made loud — partial indexes (P1 on < 5.0 / elastic)

Four unique partial indexes exist:

- `packages/data-schemas/src/schema/user.ts:192` and `:199` — OAuth ids
  (`googleId`, `openidId`, …) with `partialFilterExpression: { $exists: true }`
- `packages/data-schemas/src/schema/file.ts:173` — `execute_code` files
  (`$eq`-shaped filter)
- `packages/data-schemas/src/schema/group.ts:56` — group source ids
  (`$exists: true`)

AWS: [partial-index.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/documentdb/latest/developerguide/partial-index.html)
— "The partial index feature is supported in Amazon DocumentDB 5.0
instance-based clusters"; the index-properties table marks Partial as
No/No/Yes/Yes/No across 3.6/4.0/5.0/8.0/elastic. The `$exists` and `$eq`
filter shapes used here are inside DocumentDB 5.0's supported operator list
(`$eq, $exists, $and, $gt/$gte/$lt/$lte`), so on 5.0+ these indexes build.

On 3.6/4.0/elastic the builds fail — and empirically (probe: unique index over
pre-seeded duplicates, mongoose 8, autoIndex) the failure is **completely
silent**: no unhandled rejection, no log, the index simply doesn't exist and
duplicate inserts succeed. Mongoose only surfaces build errors through a
`Model.on('index')` listener, which nothing attached. `createModels` now
attaches one that logs every failed build (`packages/data-schemas/src/models/index.ts`).
Operational consequence on < 5.0 remains: OAuth-account uniqueness is not
DB-enforced — documented, loud, but not fixable in application code.

## Proven compatible — no action needed

- **Transactions**: supported on 4.0+ instance-based ("Amazon DocumentDB …
  supports transactions in Amazon DocumentDB 4.0 and later" —
  [transactions.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/documentdb/latest/developerguide/transactions.html));
  unsupported on 3.6 and elastic. LibreChat already probes at runtime
  (`packages/data-schemas/src/utils/transactions.ts`, cached in
  `api/server/services/PermissionService.js`) and falls back to
  non-transactional writes — the same mode as standalone MongoDB without a
  replica set. DocumentDB's restrictions (1-minute execution limit, no cursors
  in transactions, no retryable commit/abort) don't intersect LibreChat's
  usage.
- **GridFS**: `packages/api/src/cache/keyvMongo.ts` only constructs a
  `GridFSBucket` when `useGridFS` is set — no caller ever sets it and the
  class isn't exported (the singleton uses a plain `logs` collection). Dead
  code. Moot regardless: AWS lists GridFS as supported on instance-based
  clusters (elastic: no).
- **TTL indexes**: supported everywhere including elastic. AWS warns deletion
  is best-effort ("Documents are not guaranteed to be deleted within any
  specific period") — acceptable, since LibreChat treats TTL as cleanup, not
  as a security boundary.
- **`$ifNull`**: supported on all versions (only its pipeline-update context
  was the problem).

## Deployment requirements (documentation, not code)

- **`retryWrites=false` is mandatory in `MONGO_URI`.** AWS: "Amazon DocumentDB
  does not currently support retryable writes"; the failure mode is
  `{"ok":0,"errmsg":"Unrecognized field: 'txnNumber'","code":9}`
  ([functional-differences.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/documentdb/latest/developerguide/functional-differences.html)).
  `api/db/connect.js` passes `MONGO_URI` through verbatim, so this belongs in
  the deployment docs (and the live harness flags a URI missing it).
- TLS with the AWS CA bundle; clusters are VPC-only (tunnel/bastion for
  external access).

## Document as unsupported — elastic clusters

[Elastic cluster limitations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/documentdb/latest/developerguide/docdb-using-elastic-clusters.html):
no **unique indexes** (any), no partial indexes, no ACID transactions, no
GridFS, no change streams, `$expr` unsupported, and the cursor-methods table
even lists `sort()`/`skip()`/`limit()` as "No". The `email + tenantId` unique
index alone disqualifies elastic clusters. Recommend stating this explicitly
in the docs.

## Undetermined — honest gaps

- **The reporter's engine version and cluster type** — still unknown; it
  decides whether the partial-index caveat applies to them (5.0+: it doesn't).
  Worth asking directly on the issue.
- **DocumentDB 8.0 pipeline-update acceptance** — 8.0 added `$set`/`$unset`
  aggregation _stages_, but AWS never documents pipeline-form updates; the
  harness probe answers this live.
- **`collMod` is only "Partial"** on every version — avoid
  `Model.syncIndexes()` against DocumentDB (it may issue `collMod` beyond the
  documented `expireAfterSeconds`).
- **Read-side aggregations** (3 files: `methods/prompt.ts`,
  `methods/aclEntry.ts`, `methods/agentCategory.ts`) were not audited
  stage-by-stage; no exotic stages (`$facet`, `$setWindowFields`,
  `$unionWith`, `$graphLookup`) are used anywhere.
- **No faithful local emulator exists.** The `documentdb-local` Docker image
  is the PostgreSQL-based Linux Foundation project — AWS's own OSS blog
  confirms "a different engine than the one used in Amazon DocumentDB." Live
  regression testing must run against a real cluster.

## Regression strategy

1. **In-repo (CI today)**: the behavioral tests added in
   `user.methods.spec.ts`, `conversationTag.methods.spec.ts`, and
   `file.spec.ts` lock the pipeline-free implementations' semantics
   (first-acceptance preservation, clamp-at-zero, per-file ceiling).
2. **Live harness (this directory)**: `compat.documentdb.spec.ts` exercises
   the exact operations behind #14488 against a real cluster and prints a
   capability matrix (pipeline updates, `$$NOW`, transactions, partial unique
   indexes, TTL, `retryWrites`). Gated on `DOCUMENTDB_URI`; verified green
   against real MongoDB as a baseline. Suggested cadence: before releases and
   whenever update-operator code in `data-schemas` changes; optionally a
   scheduled GitHub Action on a runner with VPC access to a dev cluster.

## Support matrix and recommendation

| Capability (LibreChat dependency)       | 3.6 | 4.0 | 5.0 | 8.0 | Elastic |
| --------------------------------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ------- |
| Pipeline updates (**no longer used**)   | ✗   | ✗   | ✗   | ?   | ✗       |
| Plain update operators (all writes now) | ✓   | ✓   | ✓   | ✓   | ✓       |
| Unique indexes                          | ✓   | ✓   | ✓   | ✓   | ✗       |
| Partial unique indexes (OAuth ids)      | ✗   | ✗   | ✓   | ✓   | ✗       |
| Transactions (runtime-probed)           | ✗   | ✓   | ✓   | ✓   | ✗       |
| TTL indexes                             | ✓   | ✓   | ✓   | ✓   | ✓       |

**Recommendation**: support **DocumentDB 5.0+ instance-based** with
`retryWrites=false` documented as required. 4.0 functions with
partial-unique-index loss (now logged loudly at startup) — "works, with a
documented caveat". Elastic clusters: unsupported, full stop.

## Live verdicts (DocumentDB 5.0.0, 2026-08-30)

Probed by `audit.documentdb.spec.ts`, which drives the production methods
themselves rather than re-implementations.

### Correction 1 — pipeline updates returned after this document was written

Six sites reintroduced unsupported constructs between 2026-07-29 and
2026-08-30, all in code added with the durable trigger and background-task
work. Nothing caught them: every unit suite runs `mongodb-memory-server`, which
is real MongoDB and accepts all of it. `src/methods/documentdb.spec.ts` is now
a static guard against the whole class.

### Correction 2 — the transaction probe reported a false negative

`supportsTransactions` read a canary collection that does not exist, and
DocumentDB rejects a transaction touching a non-existent collection
(`Feature not supported: non-existent collection in transaction`). The probe
therefore returned `false` on an engine that fully supports transactions, and
every caller silently took the non-transactional path. Verified directly: with
the collection materialized, both read-only and multi-write transactions
commit. The probe now creates the canary first.

### Connection requirements for the live suites

Established against the real cluster; all four are load-bearing through a
tunnel and none were documented before:

- `authSource=admin` — the user lives in `admin`; a database in the URI path
  otherwise becomes the auth source and authentication fails
- `authMechanism=SCRAM-SHA-1` — DocumentDB rejects SCRAM-SHA-256
  (`Unsupported mechanism [ -301 ]`)
- `directConnection=true` — replica-set discovery returns internal cluster
  hostnames that are unreachable through a tunnel
- `tlsAllowInvalidHostnames` — the tunnel endpoint never matches the certificate

## Method sweep (2026-08-31)

`sweep.documentdb.spec.ts` drives every exported data-schemas method (509 at
the time of writing; constructor-valued exports are excluded) against a real engine, auto-synthesizing arguments,
repairing them from validation errors, and counting the driver queries each
method actually issues — a method that issues none is reported un-adjudicated
instead of silently green. Run once against in-memory MongoDB
(`SWEEP_BASELINE=true`) and once against DocumentDB, then diff the JSON
matrices (`SWEEP_REPORT_PATH`).

Corrected-harness baseline (replica-set MongoDB, real ACL cascades, index DDL
and transaction-lifecycle instrumentation, per-invocation async attribution,
seeded authority-transaction case, constructor exports excluded): **369 of 509
methods issue at least one query; zero rejections on MongoDB**. The remaining
140 issue none (validation
rejected the synthesized arguments, or a guard short-circuited); they are
listed in the matrix and shrink by adding `ARG_OVERRIDES` entries.

The first live DocumentDB 5.0.0 run (2026-08-31, pre-correction harness:
363 driven) found **zero engine rejections and zero divergences from its
matching MongoDB baseline**. The corrected harness adjudicates strictly more —
index DDL, transaction commits, ACL cascades — so the next live run is the
authoritative matrix for those surfaces.

This sweep exists because every incompatibility found so far was invisible
until someone thought to look for its class; here the engine adjudicates
whatever each method emits, known class or not.
