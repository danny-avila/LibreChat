/**
 * Driver-level completeness probe for tenant isolation.
 *
 * Tenant scoping is enforced by the storage engine's own binding — Mongoose
 * middleware today. That leaves one question no amount of reading the binding
 * can answer: does it cover *every* path, including the ones nobody enumerated?
 *
 * This probe answers it from below, by observing the commands that actually
 * reach the wire. The check does not depend on the binding being correct, which
 * is the whole point of putting it here.
 *
 * It asks one narrow, decidable question: **did the binding's own contribution
 * arrive, for the tenant that was active when the command was issued?** It does
 * not try to decide tenant-safety for arbitrary filter algebra — that problem is
 * unbounded, and every operator left open is a way for a regression to look
 * scoped. The binding emits `{ tenantId: <active> }` at the top level of a
 * filter, or unshifts `{ $match: { tenantId: <active> } }` onto a pipeline, so
 * that is exactly what is checked. Anything else is reported unscoped.
 *
 * Requires the connection to have been opened with `monitorCommands: true`.
