# Security Policy

At LibreChat, we prioritize the security of our project and value the contributions of security researchers in helping us improve the security of our codebase. If you discover a security vulnerability within our project, we appreciate your responsible disclosure. Please follow the guidelines below to report any vulnerabilities to us:

**Note: Only report sensitive vulnerability details via the appropriate private communication channels mentioned below. Public channels, such as GitHub issues and Discord, should be used for initiating contact and establishing private communication channels.**

## Communication Channels

When reporting a security vulnerability, you have the following options to reach out to us:

- **Option 1: GitHub Security Advisory System**: We encourage you to use GitHub's Security Advisory system to report any security vulnerabilities you find. This allows us to receive vulnerability reports directly through GitHub. For more information on how to submit a security advisory report, please refer to the [GitHub Security Advisories documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/getting-started-with-security-vulnerability-alerts/about-github-security-advisories).

- **Option 2: GitHub Issues**: You can initiate first contact via GitHub Issues. However, please note that initial contact through GitHub Issues should not include any sensitive details.

- **Option 3: Discord Server**: You can join our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/5rbRxn4uME) and initiate first contact in the `#issues` channel. However, please ensure that initial contact through Discord does not include any sensitive details.

_After the initial contact, we will establish a private communication channel for further discussion._

### When submitting a vulnerability report, please provide us with the following information:

- A clear description of the vulnerability, including steps to reproduce it.
- The version(s) of the project affected by the vulnerability.
- Any additional information that may be useful for understanding and addressing the issue.

We strive to acknowledge vulnerability reports within 72 hours and will keep you informed of the progress towards resolution.

## Security Updates and Patching

We are committed to maintaining the security of our open-source project, LibreChat, and promptly addressing any identified vulnerabilities. To ensure the security of our project, we adhere to the following practices:

- We prioritize security updates for the current major release of our software.
- We actively monitor the GitHub Security Advisory system and the `#issues` channel on Discord for any vulnerability reports.
- We promptly review and validate reported vulnerabilities and take appropriate actions to address them.
- We release security patches and updates in a timely manner to mitigate any identified vulnerabilities.

Please note that as a security-conscious community, we may not always disclose detailed information about security issues until we have determined that doing so would not put our users or the project at risk. We appreciate your understanding and cooperation in these matters.
