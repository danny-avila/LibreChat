# Monday.com API Tool Cleanup - Completed ✅

## Task Summary
Successfully removed non-existent functions from the Monday.com API tool as identified in the API v2 analysis.

## Functions Removed
Based on the analysis in `MONDAY_API_V2_FINAL_REPORT.md`, the following non-existent functions have been completely removed:

### 1. `getBoardTemplates` ❌
- **Removed from**: `utils/mondayWorkspaces.js` 
- **GraphQL Query**: `GET_BOARD_TEMPLATES`
- **Reason**: Board templates are managed through UI, not available via API

### 2. `updateTeam` ❌  
- **Status**: Was not present in codebase (already clean)
- **Reason**: API only supports team creation and deletion, not updates

### 3. `moveBoardToFolder` ❌
- **Removed from**: `utils/mondayWorkspaces.js`
- **GraphQL Query**: `MOVE_BOARD_TO_FOLDER` 
- **Reason**: Folders are managed separately, no direct board moving function

### 4. `unarchiveBoard` ❌
- **Removed from**: `utils/mondayWorkspaces.js`
- **GraphQL Query**: `UNARCHIVE_BOARD`
- **Reason**: API only supports `archive_board`, no unarchive functionality

## Files Modified

### 1. `/api/app/clients/tools/structured/utils/mondayWorkspaces.js`
- ✅ Removed `GET_BOARD_TEMPLATES` query and comment
- ✅ Removed `MOVE_BOARD_TO_FOLDER` query and comment  
- ✅ Removed `UNARCHIVE_BOARD` query and comment
- ✅ Maintained proper JavaScript syntax and structure

### 2. `/api/app/clients/tools/structured/utils/MONDAY_TOOL_V2_DOCS.md`
- ✅ Removed `unarchiveBoard` from boards section
- ✅ Removed `moveBoardToFolder` from boards section
- ✅ Removed `updateTeam` from teams section
- ✅ Removed `getBoardTemplates` from workspace section
- ✅ Updated documentation to reflect current available functions

## Verification Steps Completed
- ✅ **Syntax Check**: All modified files pass syntax validation
- ✅ **Import Test**: Both MondayTool.js and mondayWorkspaces.js can be imported without errors
- ✅ **Reference Check**: No remaining references to removed functions in codebase
- ✅ **Documentation Updated**: All documentation reflects the cleaned state

## Impact
- **Positive**: Tool now only contains functions that actually exist in Monday.com API v2
- **Positive**: Documentation is accurate and up-to-date
- **Positive**: No breaking changes to existing functionality (removed functions were non-functional anyway)
- **Zero Risk**: Main tool logic was already clean, only utility queries and docs were updated

## Current State
The Monday.com API tool is now fully cleaned and contains only verified, working API functions. All non-existent functions have been removed from:
- ✅ Utility GraphQL queries  
- ✅ Documentation files
- ✅ Reference materials

The tool is ready for production use with confidence that all included functions are supported by the actual Monday.com API v2.
