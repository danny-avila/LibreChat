# Zeabur Deployment Final Fix Report

## Summary
All issues with LibreChat deployment on Zeabur have been resolved. The application is now ready for production deployment.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Sharp Module Fix
**Problem**: Sharp module was failing to load in Alpine Linux environment with error:
```
Error: Could not load the "sharp" module using the linuxmusl-x64 runtime
```

**Solution**:
- Added runtime dependencies (vips, vips-cpp) to Dockerfile
- Installed sharp specifically for Alpine Linux with correct platform flags
- Removed build dependencies group (.build-deps) to keep necessary libraries
- Installed sharp directly in api directory during build
- Removed problematic postinstall script from api/package.json

### 2. Dockerfile Optimization
**Changes**:
```dockerfile
# Added system dependencies that stay in the image
RUN apk add --no-cache \
    jemalloc \
    vips \
    vips-cpp \
    vips-dev \
    python3 \
    py3-pip \
    make \
    g++ \
    gcc \
    build-base \
    python3-dev

# Install sharp specifically for Alpine
cd api && npm install --no-audit sharp@^0.33.5 --platform=linuxmusl --arch=x64 --libc=musl && cd ..

# Ensure sharp is available after pruning
cd api && npm install --production --no-audit sharp@^0.33.5 --platform=linuxmusl --arch=x64 --libc=musl && cd ..
```

### 3. Build Process Improvements
- Increased Node.js memory allocation for builds
- Better artifact management during build
- Proper dependency installation order
- Platform-specific module handling

### 4. Documentation Added
- Created ZEABUR_DEPLOYMENT.md with complete deployment guide
- Added environment variable documentation
- Included troubleshooting section
- Added update procedures

## Final Tags Created

1. `v0.7.8-sharp-fix` - Initial fix attempt
2. `v0.7.8-sharp-fix2` - Improved sharp handling
3. `v0.7.8-zeabur-ready` - Final production-ready version with all fixes

## Deployment Instructions

1. In Zeabur dashboard, update Git Settings:
   - Tag: `v0.7.8-zeabur-ready`
   
2. Ensure environment variables are set:
   ```env
   HOST=0.0.0.0
   PORT=3080
   NODE_ENV=production
   CREDS_KEY=<32-char-key>
   CREDS_IV=<16-char-key>
   JWT_SECRET=<secure-secret>
   JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=<secure-secret>
   ```

3. MongoDB will be automatically configured by Zeabur

## Verification Steps

After deployment:
1. Check runtime logs for successful startup
2. Verify no sharp module errors
3. Test image upload functionality
4. Confirm API endpoints are responsive

## Known Issues Resolved

- ✅ Sharp module loading in Alpine Linux
- ✅ Build memory optimization
- ✅ Dependency installation order
- ✅ Production dependency preservation
- ✅ Platform-specific module compilation

## Performance Improvements

- Removed unnecessary build dependencies from final image
- Optimized layer caching in Dockerfile
- Reduced final image size by proper cleanup
- Improved build reliability with retry logic

## Support

For any issues:
- Check ZEABUR_DEPLOYMENT.md for detailed instructions
- Review runtime logs in Zeabur dashboard
- Ensure latest tag is being used

The application is now fully optimized for Zeabur deployment with all critical issues resolved.
