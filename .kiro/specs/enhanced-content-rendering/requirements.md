# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature introduces an enhanced content rendering system for LibreChat that allows AI agents to display multimedia content, interactive elements, and rich media directly in the chat interface through a secure markup-based system. Instead of allowing agents to execute arbitrary HTML/JavaScript (which poses security risks), agents will use predefined markup tags that the frontend will parse and render into appropriate components.

The system addresses the current limitation where agents can only display plain text or use artifacts in separate windows, enabling a much richer and more interactive chat experience while maintaining security through controlled rendering.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user chatting with an AI agent, I want to see images, videos, and audio files displayed inline in the chat when the agent references them via URL, so that I can view multimedia content without leaving the conversation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an agent includes a direct URL to an image file (jpg, jpeg, png, gif, webp) in their response THEN the system SHALL automatically render the image inline in the chat message
2. WHEN an agent includes a direct URL to a video file (mp4, webm, ogg, mov) in their response THEN the system SHALL render a video player with standard controls
3. WHEN an agent includes a direct URL to an audio file (mp3, wav, ogg, m4a) in their response THEN the system SHALL render an audio player with playback controls
4. WHEN multimedia content fails to load THEN the system SHALL display an error message with the original URL as a fallback link
5. WHEN multimedia content is loading THEN the system SHALL show a loading indicator
6. WHEN viewing on mobile devices THEN multimedia content SHALL be responsive and not exceed screen width

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to click on specific words or phrases in agent responses to hear them spoken aloud using text-to-speech, so that I can learn pronunciation or have content read to me.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an agent uses the markup `[tts:language-code]text[/tts]` with a specific language code THEN the system SHALL render the text as a clickable element with a speaker icon
2. WHEN I click on a TTS-enabled text element THEN the system SHALL use the browser's speech synthesis API to speak the text in the specified language code
3. WHEN TTS finishes speaking a phrase THEN the system SHALL revert TTS settings back to the system default language
4. WHEN TTS is playing THEN the active text SHALL be visually highlighted with animation
5. WHEN TTS is not supported by the browser THEN the system SHALL show a tooltip indicating TTS is unavailable
6. WHEN multiple TTS elements are clicked rapidly THEN the system SHALL stop the previous speech and start the new one
7. WHEN the language code is invalid THEN the system SHALL fall back to the default language (pl-PL)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see data visualized as charts and graphs when an agent provides data, so that I can better understand trends and patterns in the information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an agent uses markup `[chart:type]data[/chart]` THEN the system SHALL parse the data and render the appropriate chart type
2. WHEN chart type is "bar", "line", "pie", or "scatter" THEN the system SHALL render the corresponding chart using Chart.js
3. WHEN chart data is a CSV URL THEN the system SHALL fetch and parse the remote CSV data
4. WHEN chart data is inline JSON THEN the system SHALL parse the JSON directly
5. WHEN chart data is inline CSV THEN the system SHALL parse the CSV format
6. WHEN chart data is invalid or fails to load THEN the system SHALL display an error message
7. WHEN charts are displayed on mobile THEN they SHALL be responsive and scrollable if needed

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to interact with simple widgets and tools that agents create, so that I can use calculators, configurators, and other interactive elements without leaving the chat.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an agent uses markup `[widget:react]code[/widget]` THEN the system SHALL render the React code in a sandboxed environment
2. WHEN an agent uses markup `[widget:html]code[/widget]` THEN the system SHALL render the HTML in a sandboxed environment
3. WHEN widget code contains errors THEN the system SHALL display the error message instead of crashing
4. WHEN widgets are rendered THEN they SHALL be isolated from the main application's JavaScript context
5. WHEN widgets exceed maximum execution time THEN the system SHALL terminate them and show a timeout message
6. WHEN widgets are displayed THEN they SHALL have a clear header indicating they are interactive widgets

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see the results of code execution when an agent writes and runs code examples, so that I can understand what the code does without running it myself.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an agent uses markup `[run:language]code[/run]` THEN the system SHALL display the code with syntax highlighting and an execute button
2. WHEN I click the execute button THEN the system SHALL run the code using LibreChat's existing Code Interpreter API
3. WHEN code execution succeeds THEN the system SHALL display the output below the code block
4. WHEN code execution fails THEN the system SHALL display the error message in red text
5. WHEN code is executing THEN the system SHALL show a loading indicator and disable the execute button
6. WHEN execution takes longer than 10 seconds THEN the system SHALL timeout and show an error message

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user on any device, I want the enhanced content to display properly and be usable, so that I can access all features regardless of my device type.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing enhanced content on mobile devices THEN all elements SHALL be touch-friendly with appropriate sizing
2. WHEN viewing on small screens THEN content SHALL not overflow horizontally
3. WHEN interacting with TTS on mobile THEN touch targets SHALL be large enough for easy tapping
4. WHEN viewing charts on mobile THEN they SHALL be scrollable and zoomable as needed
5. WHEN widgets are displayed on mobile THEN they SHALL adapt to the smaller screen size
6. WHEN the chat interface is resized THEN enhanced content SHALL reflow appropriately

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want enhanced content to load quickly and not slow down the chat interface, so that my conversation experience remains smooth.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multimedia content is large THEN the system SHALL show loading indicators and load content progressively
2. WHEN multiple enhanced content elements are in one message THEN they SHALL load independently without blocking each other
3. WHEN enhanced content fails to load THEN it SHALL not prevent the rest of the message from displaying
4. WHEN scrolling through chat history with enhanced content THEN the interface SHALL remain responsive
5. WHEN memory usage becomes high due to enhanced content THEN older content SHALL be unloaded to free resources
