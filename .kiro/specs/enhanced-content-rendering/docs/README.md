## Enhanced Content Types

### üñºÔ∏è Multimedia Content
Automatically render images, videos, and audio from URLs:
```
Direct URL: https://example.com/image.jpg
Video: https://example.com/video.mp4
Audio: https://example.com/audio.mp3
```

### üîä Text-to-Speech (TTS)
Make text clickable for pronunciation:
```
[tts:en-US]Hello world[/tts]
[tts:es-ES]Hola mundo[/tts]
[tts:fr-FR]Bonjour le monde[/tts]
```

### üìä Charts and Visualizations
Create interactive charts from data:
```
[chart:bar]{"labels":["A","B","C"],"datasets":[{"data":[1,2,3]}]}[/chart]
[chart:line]https://example.com/data.csv[/chart]
```

### üéõÔ∏è Interactive Widgets
Create interactive components (displayed in artifacts panel):
```
[widget:react]
function Calculator() {
  return <div>Interactive calculator</div>;
}
[/widget]
```
*Note: Widgets are displayed in LibreChat's artifacts panel for better integration and security.*

### üíª Code Execution
Execute code with real-time results:
```
[run:python]
print("Hello, World!")
result = 2 + 2
print(f"2 + 2 = {result}")
[/run]
```

## Integration with LibreChat

The Enhanced Content Rendering system integrates seamlessly with LibreChat's existing architecture:

- **Message Rendering**: Extends the existing MessageContent component
- **Artifacts System**: Interactive widgets use LibreChat's existing artifact panel
- **Code Interpreter**: Uses LibreChat's existing secure code execution API
- **Authentication**: Respects existing user permissions and authentication
- **Theming**: Adapts to LibreChat's light/dark theme system
- **Internationalization**: Supports LibreChat's multi-language interface

### Content Display Strategy
- **Inline Content**: Multimedia, TTS, and charts render directly in chat messages
